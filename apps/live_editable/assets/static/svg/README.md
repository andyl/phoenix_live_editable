# SVG Processing

We use SVG icons in PLE forms for an 'OK' and 'Cancel' button.

We just need a couple of icons for each CSS Framework.  We download the SVG
icons to our repo, then inline the icons into the executable during the
compilation process.

| SVG Image | Source              |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Square*   | Bootstrap Website   |
| Circle*   | Icon8 Windows Metro |
