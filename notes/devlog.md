Overview:
- Decided to use an umbrella
- Web Demo and Library all in one repo
- Separate Phoenix demo apps for each CSS Framework
- Each Phoenix app listens on it's own port

Multiple Ports - Pros:
- it works
- PhoenixLiveReload works in development

Multiple Ports - Cons:
- awkward to host on VPS
- impossible to host on Heroku or Gigalixer

Multiple Phoenix Apps - Alternatives:
- using the 'forward' statement in the routes file: couldn't get websockets working
- using `jesseshieh/master-proxy` - couldn't get it working
- prefer to run all Phoenix apps on a single port
- but for now we'll use multiple ports...
